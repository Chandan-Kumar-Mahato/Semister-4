# 1. <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/"> Finding the two Sum </a> 
 


Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
**Output:** `[0,1]`  
**Explanation:** Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

## Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`

 # 3. [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "()"`  
**Output:** `true`

## Example 2:

**Input:** `s = "()[]{}"`  
**Output:** `true`

## Example 3:

**Input:** `s = "(]"`  
**Output:** `false`

# 9)  [ Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/description/)

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "3+2*2"`  
**Output:** `7`

## Example 2:

**Input:** `s = " 3/2 "`  
**Output:** `1`

## Example 3:

**Input:** `s = " 3+5 / 2 "`  
**Output:** `5`
